            <h3>1. The Three Little Pigs</h3>
            <p>
                Once Upon A Time, there was a Mother pig who had three little pigs; their names were Flopsy, Mopsy,
                Cotton-tail and Peter. Peter was that weird cousin that nobody talked about... he was just visiting that
                day so ignore him.<br>
                One day, the Mother pig got sick of her children's lazy behaviour and their clear-as-day iPad
                addictions. So she threw them out of the house where there was no wifi. (DUN DUN DUUUUUUN) With no wifi
                and no snacks, they couldn't binge their Neefrix (actual name of streaming application changed for legal
                reasons) shows which means they had to build houses.<br><br>
                The first little piggy, Flopsy, was a lazy fat piggy. The only time he's ever run was to catch a
                gingerbread man <picture><img src="15251.jpg" alt="Gingerbread Man"></picture> who taunted him while
                saying "Run run as fast as you can, you can't catch me, I'm the
                gingerbread man!" and that gingerbread man couldn't have been more wrong in his whole life because
                Flopsy was an absolute beast when it came to hunting gingerbread men. But in other scenarios, Flopsy
                won't even lift a hair unless it's for food.<br>Anyways, Flopsy decides to use his least favourite food
                to create his house, BRUSSEL SPROUTS. I mean, Who knew such a disgusting, bitter, green VEGETABLE could
                be such a good construction material?<br><br>
                The second little piggy, Mopsy, is a bit more productive than FLopsy but he does everything poorly
                because he's always glued to a screen, his eyes are LITERAL SQUARES (mainly because of his geeky nerd
                glasses but we won't mention that). Without his mother's wifi, Mopsy is forced to do stuff without the
                dopamine hits of ChubeYoo Shortz and Clicklock which was super painful. Due to his huge dopamine
                crashes, Mopsy had to resort to other sources of dopamine such as reading the <i>Bethan's Site of
                    Entertainment</i> section of newspapers he finds in the trash while building his dirt hut, which was
                for some reason, very blocky. <br><br>
                Cotton-tail on the other trotter, was the most least spoiled of all of them, she was the GOAT at
                everything, and uses most of her iPad time studying quantum mechanics, calculus, and computer
                engineering. Not that any of the information she learned was useful, but her wonderful 2nd grade report
                card got her quickly imployed at Gogelo and Largesolid, earning her a yearly income of $16.39 Bajillion
                dollars! <br>
                Of course, that's what I would've said... IF IT WERE TRUE! Which it wasn't :(. While Cotton-tail was
                the least spoiled of all of her siblings, she had a horrible memory and can't recall a single thing she
                learns online because of her short attention span. now, I won't spare you the details because all you
                need to know is that she makes a house out of plastic straws which were horrible for the environment by
                the way, bust at least they don't melt in the rain!<br>
                <br>
                One day, the big bad environmentalist comes around to their little street and comes across the Brussel
                Sprout House. The environmentalist is very happy with this choice of building material and decides not
                to report the house to the <i>Ministry of House Building Correctness</i> and instead, walks away.<br>
                The next day, the big bad Minecraft Steve just so happens to have walked over to this area of the three
                pigs' mother's backyard. He stares at the dirt hut built by Mopsy and says, <i>"I... am Steve,"</i> then
                he turns around and leaves because if he stayed for any longer he would be trespassing but thanks to
                the 5 second rule, he could still eat his cooked porkchop. <br>
                The day after, the big bad wolf walks by and says to Mother pig who was gardening next the the three
                siblings' houses, <i>"Wow, what well behaved children you have! I can NEVER get my pups to play outdoors
                    like you can, they've gotten too stuck to their screens to even hear what I'm saying!</i>
                Cotton-tail
                pops her head out of her make-shift straw window and starts, <i>"Um, actually, Mr wolf sir, we were
                    kic-"</i> Mother pig quickly covered Cotton-tail's mouth with her trotter, gave her <b><i>THE
                        STARE</i></b> and quickly said to Mr Wolf, <i>"Haha, a mother never reveals her parenting
                    tricks!"</i> Mr Wolf smiled and shrugged before walking off.<br><br>
                THE END.

            <h3>2. Little Red Riding Hood</h3>
            <p>
                Once Upon A Time, there was a little girl who guarded the forest on a pony. She wore a red hood over
                her head and used a sniper rifle to hunt the ghastly creatures who lurked in the shadows of the forest.
                People in the nearby town called her The Hooded Rider. The Hooded Rider's nemesis, The Big Bad
                Wolf, has been prowling the forest for years, snatching children from the towns at night and
                gobbling them up for supper. <br><br>
                One day, The Hooded Rider was patrolling the woods on her little pony when suddenly, she heard a yell
                in a nearby hut. It was the wolf, <i>"All the better to EAT YOU UP WITH!"</i> She recognised the sound
                of the wolf's voice and her pony galloped toward the hut as she readied her rifle. Just as the wolf
                opened his mouth to bite down on the young girl, The Hooded Rider aimed at the wolf through the hut's
                window and pulled the trigger.<br><br>
                <b>BANG!</b><br><br>
                Glass Shattered; Shards clinking as they landed on the wooden floor, The Wolf toppled over, dead.<br>
                The Hooded Rider ran through the door to check on the girl, she wore a cape with a red hood and she
                clutched a basket in her hands, eyes wide at the dead wolf dressed in her grandma's clothing.
                <i>"If that's a wolf,"</i> the girl asked The Hooded Rider, turning to look up at her, <i>"Then where's
                    my grandma?"</i><br><br>
                The Hooded Rider looked down, assuming the worst. As she opened her mouth, about to break
                the news to the young girl, a <b>CLANK</b> suddenly came from the closet across the room. The Hooded
                Rider tensed, held up her rifle, and slowly walked toward the closet. The clanking and banging got
                louder as The Hooded Rider reached out for the door handle, she swiftly swung the door open and pointed
                her rifle at the potential threat, only to find an elderly lady there, tied up and stuffed in a laundry
                basket with a piece of cloth tied around her mouth. <i>"Grandma!"</i> Cried the young girl at the sight
                of the old lady. The Hooded Rider relaxed, strapped her rifle on her back and rescued the lady from the
                closet.<br><br>
                The Hooded Rider helped clean up the room before leaving with the dead wolf on her pony, trotting away
                as the grandma waved with the young girl at the doorway, <i>"Thank YOU!"</i> yelled the young girl. The
                Hooded Rider smiled as she galloped away, back into the woods.<br><br>
                THE END.
